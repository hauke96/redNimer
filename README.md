redNimer is a simple reminder app.

# Preparation to start

* You have Android Studio 3 installed
* You are using SDK 25
* You have Java 8 installed
* You have a working Android simulator/phone with a minimum API version of 19

# Features
Crossed out (~~this is crossed out~~) task are already done. For more detailed information, also have a look at the [current open issues](https://github.com/hauke96/redNimer/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=-label%3Adone%20-label%3Awontfix).
## For the first release
* ~~Create reminder~~
* Save reminder in local database
* Save reminder on remote server
* Specify the kind of notification
 * ~~One time (notifies one time before due date)~~
 * Multiple times (notifies at a given frequency before due date)
* ~~Locally create a notification~~
* Get a push call from the server and then create a notification
 * Use a local service if there's no connection to the server
* Get optional notifications via E-Mail

## Future music/Ideas
* Create account on server
* Share reminder with other people
 * First create a sharing-token (Number, unique name, QR-Code, whatever)
 * Later (this is the real goal) search user and add them as friends
* Create desktop application
